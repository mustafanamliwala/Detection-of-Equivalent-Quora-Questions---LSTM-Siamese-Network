# Detection-of-Equivalent-Quora-Questions---LSTM-Siamese-Network
Project utilizing Word2Vec, Glove and Bert Embeddings to check similarity between question pairs

Download Glove Embeddings of 300d from google and import it to run for Glove embeddings

For Bert embeddings it will take some time to load, download, and make the embeddings as it is a larger model to bear it

Thanks :)
